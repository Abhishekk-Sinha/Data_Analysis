This is not true for series/columns of dtypes `bool` -- the output here is of dtype `object`.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```py\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n# pd.__version__ == '2.2.0'\\r\\n\\r\\ns = pd.Series([True, True, False, False, True])\\r\\nd = s.diff()\\r\\n```\\r\\nIndeed, the underlying function [algorithms.diff](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v2.2.0/pandas/core/algorithms.py#L1363) explicitly differentiates between boolean and integer dtypes.\\n\\n### Suggested fix for documentation\\n\\nThe `Notes` section should read something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n-----\\r\\nFor boolean dtypes, this uses :meth:`operator.xor` rather than\\r\\n:meth:`operator.sub` and the result's dtype is ``object``.\\r\\nOtherwise, the result is calculated according to the current dtype in {klass},\\r\\nhowever the dtype of the result is always float64.\\r\\n```\",\n",

The solution in this PR is to construct the pd.DataFrame/Series and pass that to the subclass's `_constructor`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis removes _sliced_from_mgr and _expanddim_from_mgr, as they are not really necessary, simplifying things a bit.  Also makes _from_mgr `@final`.  Can separate these simplifications into their own PR on request.  xref #56681.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor subclasses that currently have special handling for Manager objects in their `__init__`, they will need to move that special handling to the appropriate `_constructor(_foo)?_from_mgr` method.  The only package I'm aware of that does this is geopandas, so this includes a shim special-casing GeoDataFrame intended to maintain the current behavior until they have time to move that logic.  cc @jorisvandenbossche ATM the shim is only in _constructor_from_mgr, pls advise on whether something analogous is needed in constructor_sliced_from_mgr and _constructor_expanddim_from_mgr.\",\n",

              "  'body': 'Maybe worth a PDEP, but opening as an issue first to see what other people think, and see if it\\'s needed or worth the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe status quo for dependencies in pandas has been to depend on numpy, pytz, and dateutil, and for everything else just make them optional. This has been working reasonably ok, but I don\\'t think it\\'s ideal, and [the discussion](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57424) on whether PyArrow should be required or optional is one example of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my opinion, there are two main things to consider. The first one is about users, and I see two broad groups:\\r\\n1. The average user who will `pip/conda install pandas` and wants things to work without much hassle\\r\\n2. The advanced user who wants more control on what is installed\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the current approach favors group 2, and causes users in group 1 to experience many exceptions on missing dependencies if they want to use key functionalities like `.read_excel()` or `.plot()` or have suboptimal performance if they use `.read_csv()` and others and miss PyArrow. Of course this is avoided if they install pandas with a distribution that includes the dependencies, which I think it\\'s common.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a second thing that it\\'s how code is structured for soft dependencies, but I will leave it out of this discussion, as it\\'s another complex but somehow independent topic.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I propose regarding the packaging is what many other packages do, for example R in the packaging on Linux distributions. Distribute two different packages `pandas` and `pandas-core`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe existing package `pandas` would be renamed to `pandas-core`, and users who would want a minimal installation would be able to use it. A new metapackage would be created with the existing name `pandas`. It\\'d be a metapackage / \"empty\" package with just dependencies to `pandas-code`, `pyarrow`, `matplotlib`... and any other package we consider important to have by default.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think this would solve in a reasonable way the discussion on whether to make PyArrow required, and in general improve the experience of most pandas users.\\r\\n\\r\\n@pandas-dev/pandas-core thoughts?',\n",

              "  'body': 'In Pandas 1.5.3, the `float(val)` cast was inline to the `cast_from_unit` call in `array_with_unit_to_datetime`. This caused the intermediate (unnamed) value to be a Python float.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince #50301, a temporary variable was added to avoid multiple casts, but with explicit type `cdef float`, which defines a _Cython_ float. This type is 32-bit, and causes a loss of precision, and a regression in parsing from 1.5.3.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince `cast_from_unit` takes an `object`, not a more specific Cython type, remove the explicit type from the temporary `fval` variable entirely. This will cause it to be a (64-bit) Python float, and thus not lose precision.\\r\\n\\r\\nFixes #57051\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] closes #xxxx (Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number)\\r\\n- [x] [Tests added and passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#writing-tests) if fixing a bug or adding a new feature\\r\\n- [x] All [code checks passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#pre-commit).\\r\\n- [n/a] Added [type annotations](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#type-hints) to new arguments/methods/functions.\\r\\n- [x] Added an entry in the latest `doc/source/whatsnew/vX.X.X.rst` file if fixing a bug or adding a new feature.\\r\\n',\n",

              "  'body': \"## Summary\\r\\nThe current docstring for `to_string()` does not provide detail on how missing values are handled when using `formatters`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis change adds an additional block to the `formatters` docstring explaining that `formatters` are **not** invoked for missing values. It also provides some guidance on how per-column formatting of missing values can be achieved.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Background\\r\\nThis issue came to my attention while fixing a bug likely caused by a misunderstanding of how `to_string()` handles missing values. Specifically, formatters were assumed to be invoked on all values, including missing ones (which is not the case).\\r\\n\\r\\n### Further issues\\r\\n- It is slightly unclear to me how broadly this behaviour applies (I've seen it with `DataFrame.to_string()`, and the implementation appears to be generic). I could be wrong though.\\r\\n- **Possible bug:** `NDFrame.to_latex()` takes a parameter called `formatters`, but following that through leads to the function `_to_latex_via_styler()` which **does not use the formatters parameter**!?\\r\\nThis looks like a potentially incomplete implementation without annotation (at `pandas/core/generic.py` , line ~3519). I can raise an issue for that separately if desired.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Checks\\r\\n~~- [ ] [Tests added and passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#writing-tests) if fixing a bug or adding a new feature~~\\r\\nNot applicable: no new code.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [ ] All [code checks passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#pre-commit).\\r\\n  - Most tests passed. Exhaustive pre-commit suite did not complete due to failure of a check _completely unrelated to this change_ (incorrect type passed to `BaseBlockManager.copy()` in `pandas/core/generic.py`).\\r\\n\\r\\n~~- [ ] Added [type annotations](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#type-hints) to new arguments/methods/functions.~~\\r\\nNot applicable: no new code.\\r\\n\\r\\n~~- [ ] Added an entry in the latest `doc/source/whatsnew/vX.X.X.rst` file if fixing a bug or adding a new feature.~~\\r\\nNot applicable: this is just an improvement to documentation of existing functionality.\\r\\n\",\n",

              "  'body': \"### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [X] I have checked that the issue still exists on the latest versions of the docs on `main` [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/)\\n\\n\\n### Location of the documentation\\n\\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html#pandas.DataFrame.groupby\\r\\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/user_guide/groupby.html#\\n\\n### Documentation problem\\n\\nIn my broad view of things, groupby can work on any (combination of) hashables, but there can be some unintuitive situations that should be mentioned in the docs.\\r\\n\\r\\nE.g., the following should and does work (work as in there is no exception, but the results are not necessarily as expected):\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [False, 1, True, 'string'], 'b': [1, 2, 3, 4]})\\r\\n        a  b\\r\\n0   False  1\\r\\n1       1  2\\r\\n2    True  3\\r\\n3  string  4\\r\\n\\r\\n# let's groupby on 'a':\\r\\n>>> df.groupby('a').describe()\\r\\n           b\\r\\n       count mean       std  min   25%  50%   75%  max\\r\\na\\r\\nFalse    1.0  1.0       NaN  1.0  1.00  1.0  1.00  1.0\\r\\n1        2.0  2.5  0.707107  2.0  2.25  2.5  2.75  3.0\\r\\nstring   1.0  4.0       NaN  4.0  4.00  4.0  4.00  4.0\\r\\n```\\r\\nWe can see that the value `1` and `True` were grouped together. From a Python background, that is not unexpected, as `1 == True` evaluates as `True`, i.e. `1` and `True` are equal and thus in the same group.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this data layout may be questionable, it certainly happens in reality. I find myself often using (abusing?) `groupby()` on multiple cols to identify unique combinations of values, and in this case, I would not want `1` to be considered equal to `True` (or `0` equal to `False` and whichever other 'convenience' conversions Python does).\\r\\n\\n\\n### Suggested fix for documentation\\n\\n\\r\\nI think the docs could benefit from mentioning this pitfall. The suggested workaround that I see would be to first convert the columns to strings before the `groupby`:\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> df.groupby(df['a'].apply(str)).describe()\\r\\n           b\\r\\n       count mean std  min  25%  50%  75%  max\\r\\na\\r\\n1        1.0  2.0 NaN  2.0  2.0  2.0  2.0  2.0\\r\\nFalse    1.0  1.0 NaN  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0\\r\\nTrue     1.0  3.0 NaN  3.0  3.0  3.0  3.0  3.0\\r\\nstring   1.0  4.0 NaN  4.0  4.0  4.0  4.0  4.0\\r\\n```\\r\\n\",\n",

As illustrated by the case with the `'string'` value, Pandas is lenient and sorts booleans and strings without complaining, which is not technically correct, and it would be convenient if this behavior is extended to other types.\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nI realize that the suggested change may be a conflicting one as the argument `sort=True` clearly requests a sorted output. For applications that would rely on this output being indeed sorted, it might be better to be more strict and keep having an error. In this case, however, it would be good to get a hint that `sort=False` would solve the issue. But then again, there's the issue that it currently is supported between non-sortable values (string vs bool), and for consistency, I would suggest the `sort` argument be ignored.\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\n_No response_\",\n",

It should preserve the original names instead.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nFirst `factorize()` should return `(np.array([], dtype=np.intp), empty_ix)`\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond example should return `[\\'a\\', \\'i\\']` instead of `[None, None]`\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : fd3f57170aa1af588ba877e8e28c158a20a4886d\\r\\npython                : 3.11.6.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 4.18.0-348.20.1.el8_5.x86_64\\r\\nVersion               : #1 SMP Thu Mar 10 20:59:28 UTC 2022\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_GB.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_GB.UTF-8\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.3\\r\\npytz                  : 2023.3.post1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.0.3\\r\\npip                   : 23.3.2\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : 7.4.4\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.1.9\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 5.1.0\\r\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : 8.20.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.7\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2023.12.2\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.2\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.58.1\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 14.0.2\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : 2024.1.0\\r\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.4\\r\\nqtpy                  : 2.4.1\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

It should return zero, but instead returns a value. \\r\\n\\r\\nSwitching to using the Pandas float32 dtype alleviates the error, as does using `np.std` on the numpy values of the series. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expected behavior is the following evaluating to `True`\\r\\n```python\\r\\npd.Series([271.46] * 150000, dtype='float32').std() == 0.0\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : f538741432edf55c6b9fb5d0d496d2dd1d7c2457\\r\\npython                : 3.11.7.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Windows\\r\\nOS-release            : 10\\r\\nVersion               : 10.0.22621\\r\\nmachine               : AMD64\\r\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 151 Stepping 5, GenuineIntel\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : None\\r\\nLOCALE                : English_United States.1252\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.3\\r\\npytz                  : 2023.3.post1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 68.2.2\\r\\npip                   : 23.3.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.3\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nIPython               : 8.15.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.7\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.0\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.8.7\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.11.4\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.3\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n```\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\",\n",
