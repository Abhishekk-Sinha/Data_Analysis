        "- The Python Standard Library contains the exact syntax, semantics, and tokens of Python. It contains built-in modules that provide access to basic system functionality like I/O and some other core modules. Most of the Python Libraries are written in the C programming language. The Python standard library consists of more than 200 core modules. All these work together to make Python a high-level programming language. Python Standard Library plays a very important role. Without it, the programmers can’t have access to the functionalities of Python. But other than this, there are several other libraries in Python that make a programmer’s life easier.\n",
        "1. TensorFlow: This library was developed by Google in collaboration with the Brain Team. It is an open-source library used for high-level computations. It is also used in machine learning and deep learning algorithms. It contains a large number of tensor operations. Researchers also use this Python library to solve complex computations in Mathematics and Physics.\n",
        "2. Matplotlib: This library is responsible for plotting numerical data. And that’s why it is used in data analysis. It is also an open-source library and plots high-defined figures like pie charts, histograms, scatterplots, graphs, etc.\n",
        "3. Pandas: Pandas are an important library for data scientists. It is an open-source machine learning library that provides flexible high-level data structures and a variety of analysis tools. It eases data analysis, data manipulation, and cleaning of data. Pandas support operations like Sorting, Re-indexing, Iteration, Concatenation, Conversion of data, Visualizations, Aggregations, etc.\n",
        "4. Numpy: The name “Numpy” stands for “Numerical Python”. It is the commonly used library. It is a popular machine learning library that supports large matrices and multi-dimensional data. It consists of in-built mathematical functions for easy computations. Even libraries like TensorFlow use Numpy internally to perform several operations on tensors. Array Interface is one of the key features of this library.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. SciPy: The name “SciPy” stands for “Scientific Python”. It is an open-source library used for high-level scientific computations. This library is built over an extension of Numpy. It works with Numpy to handle complex computations. While Numpy allows sorting and indexing of array data, the numerical data code is stored in SciPy. It is also widely used by application developers and engineers.\n",
        "6. Scrapy: It is an open-source library that is used for extracting data from websites. It provides very fast web crawling and high-level screen scraping. It can also be used for data mining and automated testing of data.\n",
        "7. Scikit-learn: It is a famous Python library to work with complex data. Scikit-learn is an open-source library that supports machine learning. It supports variously supervised and unsupervised algorithms like linear regression, classification, clustering, etc. This library works in association with Numpy and SciPy.\n",

        "As we write large-size programs in Python, we want to maintain the code’s modularity. For the easy maintenance of the code, we split the code into different parts and we can use that code later ever we need it. In Python, modules play that part. Instead of using the same code in different programs and making the code complex, we define mostly used functions in modules and we can just simply import them in a program wherever there is a requirement. We don’t need to write that code but still, we can use its functionality by importing its module. Multiple interrelated modules are stored in a library. And whenever we need to use a module, we import it from its library. In Python, it’s a very simple job to do due to its easy syntax. We just need to use import."

When operating on arrays of different shapes, NumPy automatically broadcasts the smaller array over the larger one so that they have compatible shapes for the operation.\n",
